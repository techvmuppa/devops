Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are essential components of modern software development workflows. They automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of applications. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, an open-source automation server, and Docker, a popular containerization platform.

Prerequisites:

	1.	Basic understanding of Docker and containerization concepts.
	2.	A working Jenkins installation. You can either install Jenkins locally or use a cloud-based Jenkins instance.
	3.	Docker installed on your system or Docker Hub account for pushing Docker images.

Step 1: Install Jenkins

	•	If you haven’t already installed Jenkins, follow the installation instructions provided on the official Jenkins website. You can choose to install Jenkins on your local machine or on a remote server.

Step 2: Install Docker Plugin for Jenkins

	•	Once Jenkins is up and running, install the Docker plugin. This plugin allows Jenkins to interact with Docker, enabling the creation and management of Docker containers as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

Step 3: Configure Jenkins Pipeline

	•	Create a new Jenkins pipeline project and define the pipeline script in Jenkinsfile. The Jenkinsfile defines the steps of the pipeline, including building Docker images, running tests, and deploying the application.

Step 4: Build Docker Images

	•	Use the Dockerfile to define the build instructions for your application’s Docker image. Jenkins will execute the Docker build command to build the Docker image from the source code.

Step 5: Test the Application

	•	Integrate automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure the quality of your application. You can use testing frameworks like JUnit, Selenium, or pytest depending on your application’s technology stack.

Step 6: Push Docker Images to Registry

	•	After successful testing, push the Docker images to a Docker registry such as Docker Hub or a private registry. This makes the Docker images accessible to other environments for deployment.

Step 7: Deploy the Application

	•	Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to deploy the application using the Docker images built in the previous steps. Jenkins can trigger the deployment process based on predefined conditions or manual approval.

Conclusion:
In this tutorial, we’ve learned how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. By automating the build, test, and deployment processes, you can streamline your software development workflow and deliver high-quality applications faster. Experiment with different pipeline configurations and integrations to customize the CI/CD pipeline according to your project requirements.
